<p>Some mapper may have already noticed the following changes. Anyway, here is an "official" presentation of the changes concerning Austrian signals: After a significant number of Austrian railway signals was rendered since mid october, some users followed our appeal and contributed some more signal icons. Many thanks!</p>
<p>Austrian main and distant signals in form of light signals were already rendered, but now the map also visualizes the semaphore equivalents of these signals.</p>

<p>And the map now also shows the light version of Austrian (distant) speed limit signals.</p>

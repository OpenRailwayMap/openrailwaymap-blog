<p>It is now easier to use the OpenRailwayMap on smartphones and tablets: By visiting <a href="http://www.openrailwaymap.org/">openrailwaymap.org</a> from a mobile device, the user is automatically redirected to a mobile version. Opening <a href="http://m.openrailwaymap.org/">m.openrailwaymap.org</a> forces the mobile site even on a desktop computer.</p>
<p>The mobile website is - apart from the background map - fully adapted to Retina displays.</p>
<p>Provided you have an internet connection, it is as easy as never before to use OpenRailwayMap on the go. With the ability to get the own position by Geolocation API, it is possible to follow the train's location on the map. Even the question whether the train you are sitting in is currently standing in front of a block signal can be answered easily.</p>

<p>Since last friday, the data updates are running again without problems, after it had been <a href="http://lists.openrailwaymap.org/archives/openrailwaymap/2014-October/000136.html">no or only irregular updates</a> for the last several weeks.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the update process could not be switched to the Augmented Diffs of the Overpass API <a href="http://lists.openrailwaymap.org/archives/openrailwaymap/2014-October/000140.html">as intended</a>, because the format is currently not appropriate for our purposes, so we keep the current toolchain. The required space was created by changing the RAID level of the two SSDs. Instead of being configured as RAID-1, they are now configured as RAID-0, which offers twice the storage space and a slightly higher performance at no additional costs.</p>
<p>The only disadvantage of this solution is the higher risk of data loss in cases of disk failures. In my opinion this problem is not that important, as there are only a few data which are not also stored anywhere else. This data can also easily be saved periodically on another computer and restored after a total failure and the following reinstallation of the system.</p>
<p>However, an additional conventional hard disk for the server would be desirable to make full backups of the system comfortably and to restore the system in case of failure. But it costs extra money again...</p>

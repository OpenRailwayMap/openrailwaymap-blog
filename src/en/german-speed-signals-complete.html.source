<p>Since yesterday, almost all german speed signals are rendered on the map. Switching to the maxspeed layer, there are already lots of mapped signals visible on the map. Zs 3(v) light signals are not rendered yet due to a difficult visualization of the different possible signal values. There are already ideas on how to visualize there signals. Signals of temporary speed restrictions ("Langsamfahrstelle") (Lf 1/2 and 1-5) are currently missing, too. Since temporary speed restrictions are usually not mapped in OpenStreetMap, this is not a major disadvantage.</p>
<p>A demo area, where almost every speed signal is mapped, can be found <a href="http://www.openrailwaymap.org/?lat=51.20596923119336&lon=6.695265769958496&zoom=14&style=maxspeed">here</a>. The rendering of the signals on the map should motivate mappers to map even more of these signals.</p>
<p>Soon we will add more signal icons to the signalling layer and replace existing symbols by nicer icons.</p>

<p>The tagging scheme of the signals has been reorganized: The <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OpenRailwayMap/Tagging">general tagging scheme</a> has been freed from coutry-specific information in the range of signals, therefore pages for <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OpenRailwayMap#Country-specific_tagging">country-specific tagging information</a> have been created. This is easier to understand and avoids mixing of international and country-specific tagging rules. Gradually, this division is to be implemented for the entire tagging scheme.</p>

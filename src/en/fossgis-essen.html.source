<p>Last weekend (January 9–11, 2015) Alexander (<a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/User:Rurseekatze">rurseekatze</a>) and Michael (<a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/User:Nakaner">Nakaner</a>) stayed at FOSSGIS Hack Weekend at Linuxhotel in Essen, Germany. <a href="http://www.fossgis.de/">FOSSGIS e.V.</a> is quasi, but not official OpenStreetMap Foundation Local Chapter in Germany and funds free software/projects around GIS software and OpenStreetMap. <a href="http://linuxhotel.de/">Linuxhotel</a> is a hotel only for Linux and open source software training. At weekends, open source software communities can stay there for cheap prices.</p>
<p>While Alex created a <a href="http://www.openrailwaymap.org/josm-presets/">JOSM preset for Austrian railways</a> this weekend, Michael did a couple of smaller fixes and improvements. He added German crossing signals (Bü 0/1), the Sv signals of Hamburg Light Rail ("S-Bahn") and an icon for Sh 2 signs. He replaced icons of Ks signals by new ones. To be able to differ between Hp 0 ("stop") of Ks system and other systems which have a red light, he decided to change the meanings of the Ks icons. Hp 0 (red light at the top of the signal) now represents a Ks combined signal (prior Hp 0 represented a Ks main signal). Ks 1 (green light in the center) represents a Ks main signal (prior Ks 1 represented Ks combined signals). Ks 2 (yellow light at the right) represents a Ks distance signal (prior Ks 2 represented Ks combined signals).</p>
<p>Michael also improved the infrastructure style. OpenRailwayMap now renders tunnel and bridge names which are tagged using tunnel:name=* and bridge:name=*. Trams will be rendered at zoom level 10+ now and industrial tracks won't be as thick is usual.</p>
<p>As requested in a couple of bug reports, Michael improved maxspeed style. From now on, speed limits of disused and being constructed tracks will be rendered, too. We will not render speed limits of abandoned or proposed tracks.</p>
<p>Since two weeks, the tracks in the signalling layer are rendered as grey lines for a better orientation.</p>
<p>Note that these changes still need to be deployed on the webserver and are not visible on the homepage yet. This will be done soon.</p>
<p>We thank FOSSGIS for offering this location and event to improve OpenRailwayMap and look forward to the next FOSSGIS Hack Weekend. The next hacking event with participation of OpenRailwayMap will be the <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Karlsruhe_Hack_Weekend_February_2015">Hackweekend im Februar</a> in der Geofabrik in Karlsruhe.</p>

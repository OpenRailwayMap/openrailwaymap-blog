<p>Now it is possible to access our <a href="https://www.openrailwaymap.org/">website</a>, <a href="https://tiles.openrailwaymap.org/">tiles</a>, <a href="https://api.openrailwaymap.org/">API</a> and <a href="https://lists.openrailwaymap.org/">mailing list</a> using HTTPS.</p>
<p>Users who already embed our tiles or request our API in their HTTPS website will not get <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/security/prevent-mixed-content/what-is-mixed-content">mixed content errors</a> any more. And for users who have been prevented from using OpenRailwayMap content in their HTTPS-delivered website, there's no reason not to do so.</p>

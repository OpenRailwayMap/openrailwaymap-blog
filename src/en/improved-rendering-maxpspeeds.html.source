<p>After an style update, not just values ​​in steps of 5 km/h, but any speed value is considered ​​for the rendering of the maxspeed layer. The previous rendering style caused that lines with different speed values ​​were not drawn on the map. Primarily lines in the UK, where the maxspeed values ​​were tagged in km/h instead of mph (the conversion produced odd values), ​​were affected by this problem.</p>

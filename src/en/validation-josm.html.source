<p>I have often seen various tagging mistakes while mapping railroads. Some day I experienced that JOSM offers a possibility to extend the built-in validator by <a href="https://josm.openstreetmap.de/wiki/Help/Validator/MapCSSTagChecker">MapCSS-like rules</a> and thought "hey, wouldn't it be great to use this for a railroad-data-validator?".</p>
<p>Now I have started such a <a href="https://github.com/rurseekatze/OpenRailwayMap/blob/master/validator/openrailwaymap.validator.mapcss">validation file for JOSM</a>. [2] It includes a first selection of a few typical tagging issues, but I still have a very long list of more issues and will add them step by step.</p>
<p>Every railroad mapper may have experienced typcial tagging mistakes, too. It would be nice if more mappers could add some rules. The easiest way would be pull requests, but suggestions by email are also good.</p>

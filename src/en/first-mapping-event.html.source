<p>The community of railway mappers within OSM is getting bigger and the project OpenRailwayMap is expanding continously. Therefore, it is now time to get to know one another.</p>
<p>Therefore we are planning a mapping event, whose aim is to map a poorly covered area as completely as possible. To do this, we would go out in small groups to travel railways lines and explore smaller areas by foot. After this we would continue with entering the collected data and the social part of this event.</p>
<p>Currently we are still in the planning phase and clarify when and where the event will take place. The current state of planning and more information can be found in the <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/DE:OpenRailwayMap/Mappingwochenende_2014_1">OSM Wiki</a> and in a <a href="https://terminplaner2.dfn.de/foodle/OpenRailwayMap-Mappingwochenende-Nr-1-2014-53811">voting</a>.</p>
<p>We need enough participants, so that such an event can take place.</p>

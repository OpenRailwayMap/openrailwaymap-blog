<p>Since there is also an increasing number of railway-interested mappers from the non-German-speaking countries, it is now overdue to translate the tagging scheme also into English.</p>
<p>As a copy of the German page, the <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OpenRailwayMap/Tagging">English version</a> of the tagging scheme was created a few days ago.</p>
<p>For a single person the translation of this large site is not possible in the foreseeable future. Therefore, I would appreciate help with the translation. This does not only help other mappers, but also me - if I do not have to deal with the translation, I can focus my work on the technical development. The more people help, the faster the translation is completed.</p>

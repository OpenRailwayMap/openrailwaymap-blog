<p>The rendering of the track speeds has been improved so that just the tagged maxspeed value influences the rendering order. That means that high-speed lines are rendered on the top of lowspeed lines if they collide with each other. Till now, the tags tunnel=*, bridge=* and layer=* were considered for the rendering order, which, however, caused unexpected rendering results because a high-speed line in a tunnel was covered by a lowspeed line despite their higher speed. Now these are ignored by the renderer in maxspeed layer.</p>
<p>Note: The changes will be visible on the map only after an automatic rerendering of the tiles.</p>

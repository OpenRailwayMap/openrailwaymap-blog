<p>The <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OpenRailwayMap/Aktiventreffen_2014_2">second OpenRailwayMap Meeting</a> took place at user spth's home in <a href="http://www.openrailwaymap.org/?lang=de&lat=50.3678543750527&lon=8.74908502598765&zoom=14&style=standard">Bad Nauheim</a> near Frankfurt (Main) on 24 to 26 October 2014. It was a extension to the <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OpenRailwayMap/Mappingwochenende_2014_1">first "Mapping Weekend" in Cologne in July</a>. Tagging discussions, which had been skipped due to a lack of time (or too much topics), and new tagging related questions and proposals were discussed now.</p>
<p>The two other attendees, Michael (<a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/User:Nakaner">Nakaner</a>) and Alex (<a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/User:rurseekatze">rurseekatze</a>), used their journey there to map. Michael went a detour by train from Karlsruhe over Heilbronn and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odenwald_Railway_%28Hesse%29">Hessian Odenwald Railway</a> and mapped their using GPS waypoints. Alex filmed between Düsseldorf and Cologne as long as his ICE was not too fast.</p>
<p>You can find the <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/DE:OpenRailwayMap/Aktiventreffen_2014_2#Protokoll">detailled protocol</a> at OpenStreetMap Wiki. The most important topics were:</p>
<p>A <a href="http://forum.openstreetmap.org/viewtopic.php?pid=454509">discussion in German OpenStreetMap Forum</a> made us to discuss differentiation between heavy railwas, light railway lines, trams and subways on <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/DE:OpenRailwayMap/Aktiventreffen_2014_2#Freitag.2C_der_24._Oktober_2014">Friday evening</a>. We also discussed the tag railway=narrow_gauge. We think that this tag is an outdated synonym for railway=rail. We think that change these tagging in OSM database is useless.</p>
<p>If <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauntlet_track">tracks are interlaced</a>, we suggest to map all tracks as separate OSM ways and to tag these ways with railway:interlaced=yes. If passing is prohibited between two tracks, you can now use railway:passing_prohibited=left/right/yes/both.</p>
<p>The tagging discussions were continued on <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OpenRailwayMap/Aktiventreffen_2014_2#Saturday.2C_25._October_2014">Saturday morning</a>. Contrary to the rule not to tag ways both with usage=* and service=*, we decided that usage=* and service=* should be allowed for industrial siding and yard tracks to be able to differ between industrial and normal siding/yard tracks in rendering.</p>
<p>We defined new tags for meter load and axle load – meter_load=* and axle_load=*.</p>
<p>We could not reach a settlement in the question how to use maxspeed=* if there are different speed limits for different types of vehicles (e.g. trains with and without ability to tilt in curves or vehicles with/without eddy current break).</p>
<p>If a power line is mounted on catenary masts, you can now tag the mast with power=catenary_mast. This tag can also be used for the masts of trolleybusses and electric ships. We also invented new tags for power supply into catenary, jumpering of separators of catenary, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bordeaux_tramway#Electric_power_.2F_Ground-level_power_supply">ground level power supply of Bordeaux tram</a>, crossing boxes, blockposts and sidings.</p>
<p>On Saturday afternoon we went outside to map along the railway lines to Gambach and Gießen.</p>
<p>Because mappers have been using railway=owner_change, different form designation, for owner changes (e.g. between a national railway company and a private company), we decided to introduce railway=border for owner changes near country borders.</p>
<p>We also invented tags for <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Apcpsspaa.JPG">automatically rising roadway barricades</a> on Russian level crossings and <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahn%C3%BCbergang#mediaviewer/File:Great_Bentley_330.jpg">in UK used gates</a> on level crossings. If a level crossing has a saltire, it now can be tagged as crossing:saltire=yes. The new key crossing:supervision=* describes how railway personell takes care that no vehicles remain behind closed boom gates. This can be happen by a level crossing attendant, camera or radar scanners. We also decided to introduce a new tag for the time between closure and reopening of a level crossing.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OpenRailwayMap/Aktiventreffen_2014_2#Sunday.2C_26._Oktober_2014">Sunday</a> we invented signals for German trams and Berlin subway. This made us changing tagging of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linienzugbeeinflussung">LZB</a> signals. Now every signal which is related to a train protection system <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OpenRailwayMap/Aktiventreffen_2014_2#zugsicherungssignale">should be tagged as railway:signal:train_protection=*</a>.</p>
<p>Just before the end, we created tags for some facilities which can be found in depots like sand stores and drinking water supply.</p>
<p>On the retourn journey, Michael and Alex mapped, too. Michael filmed between Friedberg and Frankfurt (Main) and between Frankfurt (Main) and Weinheim-Lützelsachsen until it became too dark outside and the phone battery became empty. Alex filmed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Rhine_Railway">West Rhine Railway</a> between Mainz and Koblenz until as long as it was bright enough.</p>
